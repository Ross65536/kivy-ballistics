# kivy-ballistics
A game app called "Space Ballistics" developed with the kivy framework on python.
I developed this app in my free time to try to learn about python and the game development process, so the app may not be 'complete' (namely I had to disable sdl sounds because they wouldn't run on the android launcher.)

To try it out you can do it on Windows (or your OS of choice) if you have python and kivy installed (just run main.py). You can follow this link to set it up on windows: https://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html
You can run this app on your android device by following this link (install the launcher from the store and put the folder with this app in your main storage/kivy folder): https://kivy.org/docs/guide/packaging-android.html#packaging-your-application-for-the-kivy-launcher
